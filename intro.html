                    <p>CAD stands for Computer-Aided Design, and is used in many fields across the world. Fun Fact: anything you use is first designed on CAD, then made. The fields that CAD is usually present in is engineering and design, more specifically, mechanical engineering, industrial engineering, aerospace engineering, architectural engineering, fashion design, game design, interior and exterior design, and many more. And these engineers and designers will produce their products in different ways, some ways include 3D Printing, using a CNC Machine, molding, and hand making.</p>
                    <p>In this club, for now, we will focus on the engineering part of CAD, and producing some of those products with a 3D printer, sometimes making them by hand as a prototype. Later we will consider the aspect of using CAD to design games and use it for interior and exterior design.</p>
                    <p>In the CAD Club of Leigh High School, the main focus of projects and designing will be related to the engineering aspect of the field. We will be doing something that a real industrial or mechanical engineer will do. Some of the projects we may do for the remainder of the semester include, a Logo Design Challenge for the club, designing a CO2 Dragster, and maybe even printing it, designing the school, CADding for the Robotics Club we have at Leigh, and more. We will use the following softwares, Autodesk® Inventor® , Autodesk® Fusion 360®, and AutoCAD®. We will also incorporate 3D Printing and making things by hand into the club.</p>
                    <p>This club will go at a much faster pace than what you may be used to in a previous class or course. However, you will learn just as much or even more in this club.</p>
